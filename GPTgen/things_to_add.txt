These are things yet to be added to the simulation: 


Genes idea for the simulation:
1. vision 
    a. food
    b. other creatures 
2. movement speed - linear
3. movement speed - angular
4. size - energy consumption - energy storage
5. energy consumption - stationary vs moving
  5a. laziness - could laziness be advantageous?
