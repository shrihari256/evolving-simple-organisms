These are things yet to be added to the simulation: 


Genes idea for the simulation:
1. vision 
    a. food
    b. other creatures 
2. movement speed - linear
3. movement speed - angular
4. size - energy consumption - energy storage
5. energy consumption - stationary vs moving
  5a. laziness - could laziness be advantageous?
6. Kill gene
7. Carnivore, Herbivore, Omnivore gene
8. cancer gene
9. adventurer gene
10. energy given to offspring factor
11. competition gene

choose if it wants to reproduce or store more energy
food death
nutrition vs age curve for food
movement speed should correspond to multiple ticks so that they can eat stuff that's between points
energy expenditure proportional to magnitude of movement
collect food if its on the way from a to b
Seasons
some kind of memory
offspring and parent stick together or go separate?
sexual reproduction
continuous world


For statistics / watching: 

Mutation lineage tracking of some kind
