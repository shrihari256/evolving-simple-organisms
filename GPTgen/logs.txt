Stable Configs: 

6/27/2023:

    initial_food=50,
    initial_creatures=10,
    food_energy=30,
    creature_speed_variance=1,
    food_spawn_rate=3,
    ticks=100,
    generations=10,
    max_food=100

    Observations: usually very stable over thousands of ticks. will have to kill the simulation manually. ~60k ticks was like the highest I saw.


6/28/2023:

    width=1000,
    height=1000,
    initial_food=500,
    initial_creatures=50,
    food_energy=30,
    creature_avg_speed=30,
    creature_speed_variance=4,
    food_spawn_rate=1,
    ticks=100,
    generations=10,
    max_food=1000,
    eat_radius=10

    Observations: food stabilizes at around 100-300 units. population usually in the 15-35 range. simulation kept going on.
