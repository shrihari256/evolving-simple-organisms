Stable Configs: 

6/27/2023:

    initial_food=50,
    initial_creatures=10,
    food_energy=30,
    creature_speed_variance=1,
    food_spawn_rate=3,
    ticks=100,
    generations=10,
    max_food=100

    Observations: usually very stable over thousands of ticks. will have to kill the simulation manually. ~60k ticks was like the highest I saw.
